## ðŸŒŸ M5stick CPlus & CPlus2 SD Backpack ðŸŒŸ

<b>I've looked around and found very few sd attachments for the  <a href="https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stickc-plus-esp32-pico-mini-iot-development-kit">"M5stickC Plus & C Plus2"</a>. So I have built a very simeple one for myself and thought I'd share with the rest of the M5 users.
It's a very easy build and requires a few parts and a soldering iron. Below you'll find directions along with a few images to help you with building this "SD Backpack" as I call it.</b> 
<br>

<b>I have also designed a case that's a simple print on any 3d printer and takes around 16 mins to print. The STL file can be located <a href="https://github.com/ATOMNFT/M5stick-CPlus-SD-Backpack/blob/main/STL%20File/M5stick%20SD-Backpack%20Case%20V1.stl">HERE</a>.</b>

### Required Items
- Prototyping PCB.
- Micro SD breakout board. (Try to locate the one used in this tut as the larger ones rquire more connections)
- Small wire. (28awg should do)
- LED (this is extra and not needed. But if you use a LED try to find one like referenced)
- Soldering iron & solder.

<br>

## Instructions
<b>Start off by dry fitting the sd breakout and the gpio pins to the pcb of your choice but make sure there is enough room on the prototype pcb to fit all the pins from the sd breakout and gpio pins on the other end. <br> Once you have the sd breakout and gpio pins fitted and everything looks good, go ahead and start soldering the sd breakout to the pcb. Then move on to the gpio pins on the other end. <br>
Once all that is solder on you can start on the wires and their paths. This part is up to you how you you want to run the wires but they must be wired like in the diagrams.
